# cmx-idea-pool
What is my idea pool? My Idea Pool is a service that records your ideas! After signing up for an account, users can log their ideas and assign them scores. Every idea contains 3 scores: Impact, Ease and Confidence. Each idea can be added, edited and deleted. All the ideas will be sorted by the average of all three scores. Every API call will return 10 ideas. When not using the service, users can log out of the system.
